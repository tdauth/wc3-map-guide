Guide for creating Warcraft III maps.

## Preparations


### Look for existing maps

First you need to think about what kind of map you want to create. The important part of the preparation is to look for other maps with similar concepts.
There is tons of custom maps out there and almost every movie/map type is already covered. Hence you need to look for similar maps first and play them as long as possible to get their quality.
Sometimes maps exist but are not that good. If you are willing to put more time and work into your map it might be that your map one day becomes better but it will be a long process.

### Is your concept really something new?

Sometimes you have an idea like I did with [The Siege of Minas Tirith](https://github.com/tdauth/the-siege-of-minas-tirith) but there is a very popular [Helms Deep](https://maps.w3reforged.com/featured-maps/helms-deep) map.
Although I have created a different map, the concept is basically the same, so players might very likely keep playing Helm's Deep since they don't really mind which setting as long as it is a siege map and Lord of the Rings, so be careful if you are really making a totally new map.


### Is it possible to create this map for Warcraft III

I have started creating the funmap [Tenet](https://github.com/tdauth/tenet) based on the movie with the same name.
It features time inversion.
Warcraft does not offer real native functions for inverting stuff, so it is really hard to support everything I wanted.
Make sure that you can create your game mode easily with the existing features from Warcraft III.
Otherwise, it will become really painful and you might have to stop the project.

### Create an improved version

Another possibility is to improve an existing map which is not maintained anymore maybe with the permission of its original creator.
This is what I did with my map [World of Warcraft Reforged](https://github.com/tdauth/wowr) and other people did with other improved versions of the original map [World of Warcraft Reborn](https://www.hiveworkshop.com/threads/world-of-warcraft-reborn.80480/#resource-3941). It works when the original map is not maintained anymore and many features are missing.
Those features can be found by constantly playing the original map and complaining about missing stuff.

### Just help by improving existing maps

If the map is still maintained but the maintainer needs help you can also just play and test the map, make suggestions, stay in contact with her/him.
Many players helped me to improve my map by just playing them and constantly reporting issues.

### Steps

Steps:

* Seach for similar maps and play them all as long as possible.
* Decision: Too many good maps, so think of another idea/Not possible to create as a Warcraft III map/Contribute to existing map/Improve existing map/Create a new custom map which is better or totally different than existing ones/ Create a new map since there is absolutely none existing map like it.

### Features

Now you have to think about general stuff which your map features and why you will decide for something and against something else.

* Singleplayer/multiplayer: Singleplayer only means that you can create a custom campaign which offers you the possibilities of level changing.
* Savecodes: Save codes may allow you to 
* Custom resources vs Warcraft III resources: Custom resources might look more interesting but do not always match Warcraft's own graphic style. When you start using too many custom resources, the look of your map might become quite strange. Besides, the quality of custom resources can be either much better or much worse. If you are making a HD map, you have to make sure that there is a HD version of the resource and maybe a classics version as well.
* Create your own resources vs existing sources:
